				<h2>Hello Friends,</h2>

				<p>
					My name is Erica Munger, I originally come from China, and I live in Atlanta GA. I’ve been in the
					USA for 15 years. I was born in LanZhou southwest of China, grew up staying in the village in
					ShanDong where my father’s family originally from, we called it our family root for few years.
					Later on I moved to Bejing the capital of China started my student life and graduated from
					college in Beijing. My family are spread out all over China. I had the privilege travelling with my
					parents since I was young. Later on I started my media career right after graduation from
					Beijing Technology and Business University. I interned at Macau TV station and CCTV station
					which is the largest media station in China.</p>

					<p>I think because of the nature of my family were all over China, I got to travel in such young age,
					I was never afraid of talking and meeting new people, quite the opposite, I enjoyed and very
					curious on finding out the adventure of what’s going on outside the world. I began to see the
					value of networking and linking the right people with right resources in a very early young age.
					By the time I was done with school I already built a broad network connections. Throughout the
					years, I continue nurturing and growing the relationship I had with my Chinese tribe even after I
					moved to the States, it never stopped me from growing as young entrepreneur. I served as CFO
					and Chief digital marketing strategist of High Powered Help, Inc. since 2004. In 2013, I founded
					U.S. Direct Trading, Inc. an import / export trading company with logistics specialties. I’m also a
					founding principal of Sino-American Marketing Partners, LLC.</p>

					<p>I’m very active in the Chinese community contributing time and talent to various charities. I
					build custom marketing strategies tailored for client’s specific business. I leverage the latest
					marketing platforms and technologies to build a data-driven marketing plan that produces
					results.</p>

					<p>In the past, whenever people find out where I’m from, the very first thing they say to me is: I
					want to go to China! It’s a great “gate opener” for me. From there the conversation just flows,
					because China is such a mysterious country, the Great Wall, the rich culture, thousand years of
					history, the food and etc. Almost everyone I talk to, China is on the bucket list to go. So finally
					this year an opportunity came in I was able to collaborate with one of biggest travel agency
					company in China. After months of preparation I’m very happy to tell all my friends that this
					September I’m putting a group together to go to CHINA! To check off your bucket list, to show
					you the REAL China! ----I carefully hand selected 3 cities: Beijing, ShangHai, Xi An The top 3
					cities to visit for the first time travelers to China. You’ll see the ancient, you’ll see the present
					and you’ll see the future of China.</p>

					<p>For business owners I carefully selected ONE more city—Yi Wu to our trip for 2 extra days, we
					are going to visit THE “Whole Sale” city just down south of Shanghai where all the magic was
					made in China. So that being said if you are already doing business with Chinese manufactures
					or if you are looking for products to be made in China, this is the GOLDEN opportunity to

					contact me ahead of time. I’ll set up meetings for you to meet with manufacture representative
					in your industry. You get to meet with decision makers face to face communicate exactly what
					you need. From there, relationship is build, business transactions are established.</p>

					<p>With the warmest welcome, I am personally going to lead this trip. I’ll be there every step of
					the way to ensure your China dream is fulfilled with only pleasant memories. If you know me
					personally you know I only put the best of the best in my package. I’m inviting you to join my
					“2018 Discover China Tour”, let’s create memories together! And Thank you for the opportunity
					allowing me to show you my country!</p>

How to find more products with the very good competitive price? Spring Tour will bring you to have the additional 3 days extension trip to Yiwu, a city nearby Shanghai where people call it – the Walmart of the world. You&#39;ve probably never heard of Yiwu, but you definitely own a number of items that come from there. If China is the world&#39;s factory, then Yiwu, not Beijing, is its capital. Yiwu, a small city in Zhejiang Province, is home to the Yiwu International Trade City, also known as China Commodity City. The market has been named by the UN, World Bank, and JP Morgan, among others, as the &quot;largest small commodity wholesale market&quot; in the world.

					<p class="emphasize">Yiwu</p>
					<p>Whole day today will be the time for you to explore Yiwu to find more business opportunities. Yiwu International Trade City has five shopping districts, each the size of several warehouses combined. This mega center occupies about 46 million sq. ft., with 62,000 booths inside. From 9 am to 5 pm, over 100,000 suppliers exhibit 400,000 different kinds of products and 65% of these products are exported to over 215 countries and regions. The market contains thousands of vendors and sells to customers all over the world. The vendors represent factories from all over China, though many are based nearby Yiwu in Zhejiang, and many will take custom orders for specific products in addition to the many products they already produce.</p>

					<p>We believe you will surely find the ideal products in your explore today.</p>

					<p>Dinner will be the farewell banquet and the presentation to introduce you more about Yiwu and have Q &amp; A.</p>

					<p>Your wonderful vacation is over all too soon as you will board the homebound flight and bid a fond farewell to China today. You will gain the lost day back by crossing the international dateline.</p>

					<p class="note">Note: it will depend on the flight you will book. If you book the flight back to Atlanta by Delta, you will fly direct flight from Shanghai to Atlanta. (Delta will begin the operation on July 22), so you can save the cost from Shanghai to Beijing or other city for transit to fly back to Atlanta.</p>
