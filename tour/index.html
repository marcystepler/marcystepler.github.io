				<h2>Hello Friends,</h2>

				<p>
					My name is Erica Munger, I originally come from China, and I live in Atlanta GA now. I’ve
					been in the USA for 15 years. I was born in LanZhou southwest of China, grew up staying in
					the village in ShanDong where my father’s family originally from, we called it our family
					root. I lived there for few years. Being in a young age I ran around the village with pigtails
					and no shirts, bare foot chasing ducks and pigs all day. My family own field to grow cottons,
					wheat, we have green house filled with tomatoes all years round. There wasn’t electricity
					nor running water at the time, but yet it was the finest memory of my early childhood life. I
					Later on moved to Bejing the capital of China started my student life and graduated from
					college in Beijing. My family is spread out all over China. I had the privilege travel with my
					parents since I was young. Later on I started my media career right after graduation from
					Beijing Technology and Business University. I interned at Macau TV station and CCTV
					station which is the largest media station in China.</p>



					<p>I think because of the nature of my family were all over China, I got to travel in such young
					age, I was never afraid of talking and meeting new people, quite the opposite, I enjoyed it
					and very curious on finding out the next adventure outside my little world. I began to see
					the value of networking and linking the right people with right resources in a very early
					young age. By the time I was done with school I already built a broad network connections.
					Throughout the years, I continue nurturing and growing the relationship I had with my
					Chinese tribe even after I moved to the States, it never stopped me from growing as young
					entrepreneur. I served as CFO and Chief digital marketing strategist of High Powered Help,
					Inc. since 2004. In 2013, I founded U.S. Direct Trading, Inc. an import / export trading
					company with logistics specialties. I’m also a founding principal of Sino-American
					Marketing Partners, LLC.</p>

					<p>These days I’m very active in the Chinese community contributing time and talent to
					various charities. I build custom marketing strategies tailored for client’s specific business.
					I leverage the latest marketing platforms and technologies to build a data-driven marketing
					plan that produces results.</p>

					<p>So why do I want to take people to China? In the past, whenever people find out where I’m
					from, the very first thing they say to me is: I want to go to China! It’s a great “gate opener”
					for me. From there the conversation just flows, because China is such a mysterious country,
					the Great Wall, the rich culture, thousand years of history, the food and etc. Almost
					everyone I talk to, China is on the bucket list to go. So finally this year an opportunity came
					by as I was able to collaborate with one of biggest travel agency company in China. After

					months of preparation I’m very happy to tell all my friends that this September I’m putting
					a group together to go to CHINA! To check off your bucket list, to show you the REAL China!
					----I carefully hand selected 3 cities: Beijing, ShangHai, Xi An The top 3 cities to visit for the
					first time travelers to China. You’ll see the ancient, you’ll see the present and you’ll see the
					future of China.</p>

					<p>Why do so many trusts me to plan their business trips and/or vacations? It could be my
					matchless service, attention to detail, and vast portfolio of experiences. In truth, it all boils
					down to trust. I understand how different people like (or need) to travel. My team and I are
					real people and we take travel personally, bending over backwards to customize every
					detail of your trip to ensure you have the trip of a lifetime again and again. We customized
					to you: I build your private journey around your interests, likes, dislikes, hopes and dreams,
					even sprinkling in a few surprises along the way. Don&#39;t be surprised! We can create your
					unique experience-led vacations: from leading brand hotels to hidden gem boutique hotels.</p>

					<p>For business owners I carefully selected ONE more city—Yi Wu to our trip for 2 extra days,
					we are going to visit THE “Whole Sale” city just down south of Shanghai where all the magic
					was made in China. So that being said if you are already doing business with Chinese
					manufactures or if you are looking for products to be made in China, this is the GOLDEN
					opportunity to contact me ahead of time. I’ll set up meetings for you to meet with
					manufacture representative in your industry. You get to meet with decision makers face to
					face communicate exactly what you need. From there, relationship is build, business
					transactions are established.</p>


					<p>With the warmest welcome, I am personally going to lead this trip. I’ll be there every step
					of the way to ensure your China dream is fulfilled with only pleasant memories. If you
					know me personally you know I only put the best of the best in my package. I’m inviting
					you to join my “2018 Discover China Tour”, let’s create memories together! And Thank you
					for the opportunity allowing me to show you my country!</p>
					<p class="signature">Love,
					<br>Erica Munger</p>

			<span class="red">Extension trip to Yiwu</span> - Business Trip to Yiwu – Walmart of the World
		</h3>
		
		<p class="large">Growth and expansion are key goals for most business owners and entrepreneurs. But how can you expand your business in today’s lackluster and slow-growth economy? How to find more products with the very good competitive price? Spring Tour will bring you to have the additional 3 days extension trip to Yiwu, a city nearby Shanghai where people call it – the Walmart of the world. You&#39;ve probably never heard of Yiwu, but you definitely own a number of items that come from there. If China is the world&#39;s factory, then Yiwu, not Beijing, is its capital. Yiwu, a small city in Zhejiang Province, is home to the Yiwu International Trade City, also known as China Commodity City. The market has been named by the UN, World Bank, and JP Morgan, among others, as the &quot;largest small commodity wholesale market&quot; in the world. Spring Tour has an office there in Yiwu that can help you for your future business in Yiwu.</p>
